                       MSN was the second most popular site in the nineties. During the nineties the MSN domain was mainly used by
                        Microsoft. MSN was orginally promoted to be an online service and internet service provider. MSN offered users a
                        customizable start screen and a tutorial on how to use the internet. Its pretty weird to think people would need a
                        tutorial about learning the to use the internet. MSN.com was relaunced in 1998 after it was combined with Microsoft Internet
                        Start. The new MSN was created to be a direct competitor with Yahoo and sites like it.
